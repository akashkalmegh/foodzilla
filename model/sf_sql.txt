Step 1 : get all Data from line_item_order_history table for order_number_c

	SELECT * FROM `line_item_order_history` WHERE `line_item_placement` in (SELECT id from line_item_order where `order_number_c` =  'dgjhsgbadsk')
	
Step 2 : get all data between two date

	SELECT * FROM `line_item_order_history` WHERE  (`modify_date` 
	between '2017-01-03' and '2018-05-31') and (`line_item_placement` in (SELECT id from line_item_order where `order_number_c` =  'dgjhsgbadsk'))
	
Step 3: get all data with sum of impression and click for group by modify_date

	SELECT *,SUM(server_c) as Impressions, SUM(click_c) as Click FROM `line_item_order_history` WHERE (`modify_date` between '2017-01-03' and '2018-05-31') and (`line_item_placement` in (SELECT id from line_item_order where `order_number_c` = 'dgjhsgbadsk')) group by modify_date
	
Step 4: get all data with sum of impression and click for group by modify_date and  line_item_placement

	SELECT *,SUM(server_c) as Impressions, SUM(click_c) as Click FROM `line_item_order_history` WHERE (`modify_date` between '2017-01-03' and '2019-05-31') and (`line_item_placement` in (SELECT id from line_item_order where `order_number_c` = 'dgjhsgbadsk')) group by modify_date,line_item_placement
	
Step 5 : get Final sql query to fetch all data with date, sum of impression and click with line_item_name

	SELECT line_item_order_history.id, line_item_order.id as line_item_order_ID, line_item_order.line_item_name, line_item_order_history.modify_date,
	SUM(line_item_order_history.server_c) as Impressions, 
	SUM(line_item_order_history.click_c) as Click, 
	line_item_order_history.ctr 
	FROM `line_item_order_history` 
	INNER join `line_item_order` 
	on  line_item_order.id = line_item_order_history.`line_item_placement`  
	WHERE (line_item_order_history.`modify_date` between '2017-01-03' and '2019-05-31') and line_item_order.`order_number_c` = 'dgjhsgbadsk'
	group by line_item_order_history.modify_date, line_item_order_history.line_item_placement
